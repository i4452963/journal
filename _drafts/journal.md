Welcome to vim journaling. This is a single text-file which you can take over
and start using as a 1-file journal for the rest of your life.

The tools used to create and secure this journal (vim and git) will help you in

You can go through vimtutor enough to make new entries here and save it local.
When you are ready, we can change the git repo it's connected to and you can
secure it on your own private Github repo (optional).
